title: "Uploading Packages to Tavern"
---

The `pub` command is used to upload packages to the Tavern server.

    $ pub publish [--dry-run] [--force] [--server <url>]

Instructions for the publish command can be found at
[pub.dartlang.org](http://pub.dartlang.org/docs/pub-lish.html).

IMPORTANT: Make sure to use the --server flag to publish your packages to
[tavern.org](http://tavern.org) instead of
[pub.dartlang.org](http://pub.dartlang.org).
