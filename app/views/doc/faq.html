<h3 id="what-are-taverns-system-requirements">What are Tavern&rsquo;s system requirements?</h3>

<p>Tavern runs on any platform that supports Chrome.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-all-the-packages-directories-for">What are all the &ldquo;packages&rdquo; directories for?</h3>

<p>After you run Tavern, you&rsquo;ll notice that your package has little <code>packages</code>
directories sprinkled all over it. These are needed to make &ldquo;package:&rdquo; imports
work. When your code has an import with the &ldquo;package&rdquo; scheme, a Dart
implementation like the VM or dart2js translates that to a path or URL using a
simple rewriting rule:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take the URI of your application&rsquo;s <a href="glossary.dart#entrypoint">entrypoint</a>.</li>
  <li>Strip off the trailing file name.</li>
  <li>Append &ldquo;/packages/&rdquo; followed by the rest of the import URL.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if you app&rsquo;s entrypoint is <code>/dev/myapp/web/main.dart</code> then:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="dart"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="s1">&#39;package:unittest/unittest.dart&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Magically turns into:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="dart"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/dev/myapp/web/packages/unittest/unittest.dart&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then Dart loads that as normal. This behavior is a <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/spec/">specified</a> part of
the Dart language. The example only works if you have a directory named
<code>packages</code> inside your <code>web</code> directory and that directory in turn contains the
packages that your app uses.</p>

<p>Tavern creates these directories for you. The main one it creates is in the root
of your package. Inside that, it creates symlinks pointing to the <code>lib</code>
directories of each package your app <a href="http://glossary.html#dependency">depends</a> on. (The dependencies
themselves will usually live in your <a href="http://glossary.html#system-cache">system cache</a>.)</p>

<p>After creating the main <code>packages</code> directory in your package&rsquo;s root, pub then
creates secondary ones in every <a href="glossary.html#entrypoint-directory">directory in your package where a Dart
entrypoint may appear</a>. Currently that&rsquo;s
<code>benchmark</code>, <code>bin</code>, <code>example</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>tool</code>, and <code>web</code>.</p>

<p>Tavern also creates <code>packages</code> links in <em>subdirectories</em> of any of those that
point back to the main one. Since you may have entrypoints under, for example,
<code>web/admin/controllers/</code>, Tavern makes sure there is always a nearby <code>packages</code>
directory. Otherwise the imports won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<h3 id="i-found-a-bug-in-pub-how-do-i-report-it">I found a bug in pub. How do I report it?</h3>

<p>We use the main <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/list">Dart bug tracker</a>. Feel free to file a ticket. When you do,
please include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).</li>
  <li>The version you are running. (Run <code>pub version</code>.)</li>
  <li>If possible, include a log by running <code>pub --verbose &lt;your command&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-i-delete-a-package">How do I delete a package?</h3>

<p>Once a package is published, you&rsquo;re strongly discouraged from deleting it.
After all, some user could already be depending on it! If you accidentally
include your password or something similarly secret in the package,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/entry?summary=Request%20to%20delete%20package%20from%20pub&amp;status=Triaged&amp;labels=Type-Task,Priority-Medium,Area-Pub,Pub-DeleteRequest">file an issue</a> and the Tavern authors will take down your
package. You&rsquo;ll need to use a different version when you re-upload it.</p>

<h3 id="i-get-a-timeout-when-i-run-tavern-what-do-i-do">I get a timeout when I run Tavern. What do I do?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://tavern.org">pub package server</a> is hosted on <a href="https://appengine.google.com">App Engine</a>. We&rsquo;ve seen a few times
where App Engine has run slowly for us and other users, leading to some
timeouts. If this happens, send us a note on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/misc">mailing list</a> and we&rsquo;ll
look into it. Usually it resolves itself in a few hours.</p>

<h3 id="why-doesnt-tavern-do-">Why doesn&rsquo;t Tavern do ___?</h3>

<p>Probably because we haven&rsquo;t implemented yet. Tavern is still under active
development. If there are features you would like to see, go ahead and
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/list">file a ticket</a>. Please search and make sure it hasn&rsquo;t
already been requested yet. If it has, star it so we know what things are
important to users.</p>

<p>Also, patches are more than welcome! Tavern is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/GettingTheSource?tm=4">open source</a> and we love outside
contributions. Both the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fbleeding_edge%2Fdart%2Fsdk%2Flib%2F_internal%2Fpub">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/pub-dartlang">server</a> are well-tested,
well-documented, and, we hope, easy to contribute to.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-roadmap-for-tavern">What is the roadmap for Tavern?</h3>

<p>We don&rsquo;t generally make public roadmaps for Tavern. The Dart project is very fluid
and priorities and schedules change very frequently. If we make promises for
the future, we are likely to end up disappointing users when plans change.</p>

<p>You can usually get a picture for what we are working on now by seeing which
